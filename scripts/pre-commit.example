# pre-commit hook to update version.json
# To use this hook, copy it to the .git/hooks directory:
# cp scripts/pre-commit.example .git/hooks/pre-commit
# And make it executable:
# chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run the node script.

# --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
# Add the updated version.json using its new path.
git add client/public/version.json
