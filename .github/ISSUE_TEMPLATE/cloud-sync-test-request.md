## Cloud Sync Testing Request

Thanks for your interest in helping test cloud sync features!

- **Preferred**: Email me at `neatonjr@gmail.com` with the email address linked to your **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** account.
- Or: Leave a comment below expressing interest, and I’ll reply with next steps.

> ⚠️ **Privacy Note**: Please do **not** post your personal email here unless you're comfortable making it public.

Let me know which service(s) you'd like to help test:
